# E-Commerce Sales & Customer Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes e-commerce sales and customer behavior data to uncover patterns in revenue, profitability, and purchasing trends. Using the Superstore dataset, the goal was to understand how products, regions, customer segments, and order behavior impact overall business performance.

SQL was used for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis, followed by interactive Power BI dashboards to present insights in a clear and actionable way.
